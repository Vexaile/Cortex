# The stdlib dictionary workflow

This describes an async, ongoing process for building up a hand-curated dictionary of
language/library functions with real descriptions and documentation links, so
completion suggestions read the way JetBrains' or VS Code's do: not just a name, but
what it does and where to read more.

## Why this exists alongside the LSP

Cortex already gets real completions from clangd/pyright/rust-analyzer: scope-aware
locals, real signatures, and version-correct suggestions (clangd is driven by the
actual compiler frontend on the project's configured `-std=`, so it already refuses to
suggest `auto` under `-std=c++98` for free, no hand-maintained gating needed). That
part should stay LSP-driven. Reinventing signatures and scope tracking by hand would
both duplicate something already correct and inevitably drift out of sync with it.

What the LSP genuinely cannot give us is the one thing that started this: a link to
the real documentation page, and a description with the polish of hand-written docs
rather than a raw Doxygen/docstring dump (or nothing, for entries with no doc comment
at all). That's what this dictionary is for. It's a supplement to `detail`/
`documentation`, not a replacement for the completion engine.

## Data shape

One JSON file per language under `src/shared/stdlib/` (e.g. `cpp.json`,
`python.json`), keyed by library, then by symbol:

```json
{
  "vector": {
    "header": "<vector>",
    "since": null,
    "symbols": {
      "push_back": {
        "kind": "method",
        "signature": "void push_back(const T& value)",
        "description": "Appends a copy of value to the end of the container.",
        "since": null,
        "docUrl": "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/push_back"
      }
    }
  },
  "chrono": {
    "header": "<chrono>",
    "since": "c++11",
    "symbols": {
      "duration_cast": {
        "kind": "function",
        "signature": "template<class ToDuration, class Rep, class Period> constexpr ToDuration duration_cast(const duration<Rep, Period>& d)",
        "description": "Converts a duration to another duration type, truncating toward zero.",
        "since": "c++11",
        "docUrl": "https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration/duration_cast"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `since` at the library level gates the whole header (e.g. `<chrono>` needing
  C++11 predates any single symbol's own gate); at the symbol level it gates an
  individual addition to an existing header (e.g. `std::vector::append_range` needing
  C++23 inside `<vector>`, which has existed since C++98).
- `since: null` means "no gate, always available" - most of the C library surface
  inherited into C++, for instance.
- Cortex only ever uses this file to enrich an item the LSP already proposed
  (matched by qualified name) or to fill in `detail`/`documentation` when the LSP gave
  none. It never invents a completion the server didn't already offer, and it never
  overrides a version gate the compiler itself already enforces - if clangd offered
  it under the project's configured standard, it's offerable.

## The agent's loop

Run this as its own background/scheduled agent, separate from interactive coding
sessions, so it doesn't compete with normal work for this session's attention:

1. Pick one language, one library already partially covered (or a well-known library
   not covered at all yet - e.g. C++ has `<vector>` but not yet `<chrono>`).
2. Read that library's real reference documentation (cppreference for C++, the
   Python docs for Python, the std docs / docs.rs for Rust).
3. Diff: which public symbols does the reference doc list that `src/shared/stdlib/<lang>.json`
   doesn't have yet for this library?
4. Add 10-20 of them per run - description, signature, `since` if the symbol was
   added after the library's own baseline, and a `docUrl` pointing at that exact
   symbol's page (not the library's index page). Small batches so each run is
   checkable, not a wall of unverified entries.
5. Commit with a message naming exactly what was added (e.g. "cpp stdlib: add 14
   std::vector members").

Coverage priority order for C++ once `<vector>`/`<string>`/`<algorithm>` basics
exist: `<chrono>`, `<map>`/`<unordered_map>`, `<memory>` (smart pointers),
`<thread>`/`<mutex>`, `<optional>`/`<variant>`, `<filesystem>`. For Python:
`os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `json`, `re`, `itertools`, `collections`, `typing`. Adjust
as real usage in opened projects shows what's actually being typed.

## Verifying an entry before it ships

Before an entry is trusted, if the language's LSP is available: open a scratch file
with `#include <the header>` (or the Python/Rust equivalent import), and confirm the
LSP's own completion for that symbol actually appears - i.e. the symbol is real and
spelled the way the dictionary claims. An entry that doesn't correspond to anything
the compiler/server recognizes is worse than no entry.

## Status

The loader and merge logic are live in `lspClient.ts` (`enrichDocumentation`,
`stdlibIndex`), consulted from both `provideCompletionItems` and
`resolveCompletionItem`, and from the hover provider via the identifier under
the cursor. Seeded so far:

- `src/shared/stdlib/python.json`: `time` (full module), `os` (a few common
  entries), `random`
- `src/shared/stdlib/cpp.json`: `<vector>`, `<chrono>`

Verified live against a real pyright process (not just typechecked): a
symbol with no docstring at all in typeshed, like `time.asctime`, now shows
the curated description + example + doc link ahead of the real signature
pyright provides.

Also implemented alongside this, same file: `src/shared/stdlib/*-snippets.json`
(construct templates - `class`, `for`, `if __name__`, etc. - matched by
prefix the same way any other completion label is) and client-side
call-parens insertion (`withCallParens` in lspClient.ts) so a bare function
completion like `print` inserts `print()` with the cursor between the
parens, regardless of whether the server itself supports that.

Not yet built: the actual recurring agent that expands the dictionary
automatically. The format, loader, and merge path are proven; what's left is
scheduling the agent described above to keep growing the JSON files.
