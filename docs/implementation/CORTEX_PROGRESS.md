# Cortex Progress Log

Newest first. One entry per completed slice: what shipped, how it was verified,
and what it unblocks. See `CORTEX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the full plan.

## Editor actions + trust cleanup (Phase 0 / Phase 1 start)

Wired real LSP rename, find-references, and document-formatting providers over
the existing LSP bridge; the previously-dead Auto Format menu item now formats
C/C++ and Rust. Made the advertised menu accelerators real global shortcuts
(Ctrl+O, Ctrl+comma, Ctrl+Shift+M, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+T). Added the four editor
actions to the command palette. Replaced the decoy status-bar git-branch icon
with a folder icon. Rename applies correctly across files (active file undoable
via Monaco, other clean files rewritten on disk with open tabs synced, dirty
cross-file targets refused with a clear message). Extracted the edit-application
into a pure, unit-tested shared helper (`src/shared/textEdit.ts`) reusable by the
future agent file-edit tool.

Verified: formatting reflowed a real file live through clangd (Monaco has no
built-in C++ formatter, proving the new provider + bridge path). Typecheck clean,
full suite green (507 passed), textEdit helper unit-tested (7 cases).

Unblocks: the file-edit-with-diff step of the AI agent (Phase 3) reuses the
edit helper; the references/goto gap it exposed points directly at the clangd
include-config work (Phase 2).

## Hardware graph + Hardware panel

Bus and include scanning added to the project model; `src/shared/hardwareGraph.ts`
derives a board/pin/bus/device/file graph with provenance edges and a strictly
gated bus-attachment inference. New Hardware sidebar panel with click-to-jump.
Verified live against a real ESP32 project; 18 graph tests plus adversarial
multi-agent review of the diff.

## Project model

`buildProjectModel` derives languages, board (from platformio.ini only), and
GPIO pin usage, excluding vendored dirs. Feeds the AI context and a status-bar
board indicator. Tested.
