# Backlog (production readiness for 100k+ users)

Source: multi-agent completeness audit against a "$50M startup, 100k users" bar. Ordered by
priority (1 = do next). Status updated as items ship.

## Genuinely done-done
- Editor shell: Monaco + cortex-dark theme, tabs with dirty tracking, minimap, per-extension
  language detection, Ctrl+S / F5.
- Workspace: open folder, lazy tree, filesystem watching.
- Native run for C/C++ (compiler/std/optimization), Python, JavaScript, and Rust, with compiler
  diagnostics parsed into inline Monaco markers + a Problems panel.
- arduino-cli boards: availability check, list connected/installable, Verify + Upload with FQBN
  selector persisted to `.cortex/config.json`, graceful degradation.
- Simulator MVP: real `setup()`/`loop()` compiled against a host Arduino shim, streaming live
  LEDs/PWM/buttons/buzzer + serial. Verified end-to-end.
- Serial monitor with discovery, baud, send, timestamps, and a live auto-plotter.
- AI: provider-agnostic SSE streaming across Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and any OpenAI-compatible or
  local endpoint, with active-file context.
- Security baseline: contextIsolation on, nodeIntegration off, network in main, production CSP.
- TypeScript strict across the codebase; `npm run typecheck` passes.

| 17 | Extract sim protocol parser to shared; fix malformed-line drops + tests | testing | medium | M | **done** |

## Next big build (from research): 2D-first SVG simulator
The research pass recommends a **2D SVG** simulator editor (Wokwi and Tinkercad are both 2D; 3D
fights the wiring loop), with a renderer-agnostic netlist (union-find) so an **optional** 3D showcase
view (three.js / react-three-fiber) can be added later for the hero and camera/servo demos. Target
components: LED, resistor, pushbutton, potentiometer, servo, buzzer, 7-segment, LCD1602, SSD1306
OLED, NeoPixel, HC-SR04, DHT22, plus Uno/Nano/Mega/ESP32/Pico boards. Cycle-accurate engine via
avr8js (AVR) and rp2040js (Pico) once a compile-to-hex path exists. See [`SIMULATOR.md`](SIMULATOR.md).
