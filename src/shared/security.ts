 *
 *   -fplugin=./x.so   loads a repo-supplied shared object into the compiler
 *   -B.               points the driver at a repo-local as/ld/cc1
 *   -specs=./evil     rewrites the whole driver spec
 *   @file             reads more arguments from a repo file
 *   -o <path>         a second -o wins, so the executable lands anywhere
 *   -Wl,...           hands arbitrary options to the linker
 *   a bare filename   adds another translation unit to the build
 *
 * So this is an allowlist of NAMED FLAGS, not a blocklist and not open prefixes:
 * an argument has to be one whose whole purpose is describing this translation
 * unit (defines, include/library search, warnings, target/codegen tuning).
 * A rejected argument is reported, never silently dropped.
 *
 * Named, because a prefix rule like /^-f(?!plugin)./ blocks the spelling you
 * thought of and nothing else: it still admitted clang's -fpass-plugin=<dso>
 * (the same dlopen-into-the-compiler primitive under another name) and the whole
 * -fdump-*=<path> / -ftime-trace=<path> family, each writing a file anywhere on
