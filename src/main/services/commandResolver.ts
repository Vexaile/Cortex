 * libuv's process spawn searches the CHILD'S WORKING DIRECTORY before it scans
 * PATH. Every spawn here runs with a cwd inside the user's project - the runner
 * uses the file's directory, the LSP uses the workspace root - so a repository
 * containing `main.py` next to a malicious `python.exe` executed that binary the
 * moment the user pressed Run. No config file, no setting, no prompt.
 *
 * Verified on this machine against electron 33's libuv: a planted
 * `<repo>/python.exe` ran in place of the real interpreter.
 *
 * Setting NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath in the child's environment does not
 * help, because the search happens in the parent. The fix is to do the lookup
 * ourselves, from PATH only, and hand spawn an absolute path.
